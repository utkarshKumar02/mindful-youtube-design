# 🎯 Mindful Watching Without Killing Engagement

This project is a redesign concept for YouTube’s mobile video viewing experience. The idea is to help people become more aware of their screen time and make mindful choices — without breaking the fun of watching.

## 🧩 What’s This About?

People often watch videos for hours without realizing how much time has passed. We wanted to design something that:
- Helps you track your watch time
- Encourages breaks
- Still feels like the real YouTube experience

The challenge was: do all this **only through UI/UX design**, no backend logic or popups that block your screen.

## 🛠️ What I Designed

Here’s a quick overview of what’s included in this design:

### 1. **Video Player Screen**
- Fullscreen video with standard YouTube controls
- A subtle gradient background that shifts slowly as you keep watching
- A floating session mini-card showing:
  - Session duration
  - A soft pulsing animation after extended watch time
  - A progress bar that changes color over time

### 2. **Your View Insights**
When the user taps the floating session card, a smooth bottom sheet appears:
- Today’s watch time
- Current session duration
- Weekly trend overview
- Mindful viewing goals
- Two helpful CTAs:
  - `Set Viewing Goals`
  - `Adjust Reminder Settings`

### 3. **Set Viewing Goals Page**
- Simple slider to set your daily watch time limit
- Break reminder preferences (with duration & frequency)
- Additional mindful toggles (like pause autoplay, receive weekly reports, etc.)

## 💬 Thought Process

We didn’t want to break the dopamine loop that makes YouTube so engaging. So instead of hard stops or boring warnings, we added:
- Gradual visual changes
- Friendly reminders
- Space for users to set their own rules

This way, users stay in control but get gentle nudges to stay mindful.

---

## 🤝 Tools

- Designed in Figma using 4-column stretch grid
- Fonts and colors based on YouTube’s brand guidelines

- This project gave me a chance to explore YouTube through a designer’s perspective — a platform I’ve always loved.
Grateful to the organizers for the opportunity to bring this vision to life.
